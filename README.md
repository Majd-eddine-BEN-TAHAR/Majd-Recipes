# Majd-Recipes

A recipes application using ReactJS and tailwindcss
This project was bootstrapped with [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) and [tailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Project idea:

This project will be a single-page application that allows users to browse and save their favorite recipes. The application will use the Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to fetch recipe data.

## Pages:

1. Home page: This page will display a list of recipe categories, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. Each category will have a thumbnail image and a title.
2. Recipe list page: This page will display a list of recipes for a specific category. The user will be able to access this page by clicking on a category from the home page. Each recipe will have a thumbnail image, title, and a brief description.
3. Recipe detail page: This page will display detailed information about a specific recipe, such as the recipe image, title, description, ingredients, and instructions. The user will be able to access this page by clicking on a recipe from the recipe list page. The ID of the selected recipe will be passed in the URL, and the data for that recipe will be fetched from the API and displayed on this page.
4. My Recipes page: This page will display a list of the user's saved recipes. The user will be able to add recipes to this list from the recipe detail page. Each saved recipe will have a thumbnail image, title, and a brief description.
